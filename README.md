#RTv1 @ 42
"Mon premier Ray Tracer"

The goal of this project is to create a raytracer that supports basic features:
lighting, 4 primitives (sphere, plane, cone, and cylinder) and a movable camera.
Optional features include phong lighting and being able to place more than one
light in the scenes.

#Compiling and running
There is currently nothing to run, but it will be there shortly!
